## How Do We Involve the Next Generation of Young Minds?

Jim McClure and I (@Dj Daugherty) were recently involved in a copter build with the Avon Tech Club @ 
the Avon High School. It was a thought-provoking day of watching young minds explore and create.

There is an ancient Chinese proverb... “Tell me and I'll forget; show me and I may remember; 
involve me and I'll understand.”

So... where am I going with this? The topic for this weeks @WeeklyBlogger will be based on this 
proverb. How do we involve the next generation of young minds? These young minds will define each 
new business idea and will expand our technologies. How do we help these young people become all 
they can be? 

Your post will be due by end-of-day, 4/10/2015. Please attach your post URL to the WeeklyBlogger 
group.

thanks.
