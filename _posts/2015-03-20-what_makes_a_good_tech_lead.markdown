## What Makes a Good Tech Lead

Imagine a team.  Imagine a person on that team.  Imagine a person on that
team, assigned the role of tech lead.

I have in my mind, what a 'good' (not even a 'great') tech lead should be.  I
then started questioning my thoughts and decided that I work with some of the
smartest people and they will all have opinions. I asked the following...

what is a good tech lead? what makes a person capable of being a good tech 
lead? What are the personalities/traits of this person? Why are some people 
just good at it... and others (even really technically talented) are just 
not! Please expand the topic as much as you like. I am sure each of you 
have experience... good and bad.  please write a blog with your thoughts.

After reading all of the submissions and consulting with the oracles, I have finally made a decision.  Each submission was great
in its own right, but one captured all of the nuances of what it means to be a 'Pillar Tech Lead'.  Ironically, he was 
one of the last to submit and questioned his ability to write a 'good' blog post.  Once again, Kevin shows all of us... just how it
is supposed to be done.

Thanks Kevin !
