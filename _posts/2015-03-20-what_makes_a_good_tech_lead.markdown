## What Makes a Good Tech Lead

Imagine a team.  Imagine a person on that team.  Imagine a person on that
team, assigned the role of tech lead.

I have in my mind, what a 'good' (not even a 'great') tech lead should be.  I
then started questioning my thoughts and decided that I work with some of the
smarted people and they will all have opinions. I asked the following...

what is a good tech lead? what makes a person capable of being a good tech 
lead? What are the personalities/traits of this person? Why are some people 
just good at it... and others (even really technically talented) are just 
not! Please expand the topic as much as you like. I am sure each of you 
have experience... good and bad.  please write a blog with your thoughts.

My original request for submissions indicated that I would... 

>ask for some assistance to read and one will be picked to be featured on 
the Pillar blog. 

After reading all of the submissions, I decided this will no longer be the format... all 
submissions will be presented within the post and the public can make their own 
decision.

later.
